Changelog

Version 7.0
* [Feature] Added support for WEBM videos. The option is off by default, but can be enabled in the options. The sound is also defaulted off, and I'll have to make it a sticky setting later.
* [Change] Changed 'seconds per image' to 'seconds per slide'
* [Change] Changed 'auto-fit image' to 'auto-fit slide'
* [Bug fix] Cleared max width/height values are now saved.

Version 6.1
* [Feature] Added support for site derpibooru.org
* [Feature] Added a "Searching for images..." indicator on initial search.

Version 6.0
* [Feature] Added tag associations. This allows for cross-booru searching of related tags. This currently only supports "rating", "sort", and "order" tags, but lays the groundwork for more to come.
* [Feature + Bug fix] Results were all originally sorted by date, even if they were sorted within the query. Added the first implementation of sorting based on your search, with it defaulting to date just like the boorus. Sorting will be refined further in the future, but please send feedback on any issues that you notice.
